# Pterodactyl Attack

[![logo](readme/logo.png)](http://pteroattack.com)

[Pterodactyl Attack](http://pteroattack.com) is an iOS game made at [Hygoon
Studio](http://hygoon.com).  It was created in Javascript/HTML5/Canvas2D from
the ground up and can be played from the web browser as well as mobile devices
via [CocoonJS](https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/).

This repository contains our entire development workspace for the game (code,
assets, tools, server, build scripts).  It also contains the entire
history of revisions from its early prototype on January 2013 to its current
completed stage on January 2014.

## The Book

To understand the context of our game, code, and tools, I highly recommend
reading our comprehensive illustrated guide that covers the high- and low-level
details of our workflow: <http://pteroattack.com/#quick-look>

This provided context should make it a lot easier to dive into the code
and workspace.
